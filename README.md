# What Lies Unseen - A Witcher 3 Cut Content Document Series

Greetings,

This is a series of documents aimed at presenting original quest plans for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to serve as inspiration for mod authors. For the unaware, The Witcher 3 underwent many story revisions during its several year development cycle with numerous concepts changed around, scrapped, or added. This is the cumulation of several months worth of work and is now ready to be viewed.

The series encompasses the following volumes:

    Volume 1 - A Time of Sword and Axe (2012 version of the story)
    Volume 2 - The Beginning (2013 version of the story)
    Volume 3 - Rewrite 1.0 (mid-2013 version of the story)
    Volume 4 - Rewrite 2.0 (2014 version of the story)
    Volume 5 - Expansion Packs (Both Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine/Bells of Beauclair)


Currently Volumes 1 and 2 are available, as well as a smaller document that previews the The War questline from 2014, better known as the famed Catriona Plague questline. In time, all the volumes will be completed, there is no ETA on when this will be.


Finally, these documents are extremely long and will take some time to read (several hours at least). If you prefer a visual breakdown of these quests then you can watch the following video by xLetalis who has worked extensively on this, big props to him. It covers Volume 1 at this time:
